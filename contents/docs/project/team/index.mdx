**Electrical Engineering**

Davi Dantas will graduate with Honors in Electrical Engineering from the University of Central Florida in Spring 2025. His industry experience spans control‑systems work at Smurfit, PCB design for space environment at Nuview, and FPGA development at Aeronix. For his Northrop Grumman–sponsored Senior Design project, Davi dove deep into SystemVerilog and Universal Verification Methodology, applying them to the modular stages of a RISC‑V core. He drove functional coverage to 85 percent on the Execute stage, Decoder, and memory‑management finite‑state machine.

**Computer Engineering**

Pablo Rodriguez will obtain his Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the University of Central Florida in Spring 2025. His professional experience includes IT systems and networks, high performance computing administration, and data center operations. During his senior design capstone project, he worked on system design and implementation of the memory architecture, alongside with prototyping an SoC realizable for FPGA with a RISC-V softcore and auxiliary peripherals.
Rodriguez will pursue a Master's degree starting in the later half of 2025.
