## About Digital ASIC Tapeout

The Digital ASIC Tapeout project, sponsored by Northrop Grumman, focuses on training a team of students to proficiently execute the full‑flow digital design of an Application‑Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). This hands‑on project challenges students to implement a RISC‑V processor core using industry‑standard Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools such as Cadence, while adhering to advanced design principles.

The project's main objective is to develop a custom digital ASIC capable of efficiently processing 100 million instructions per second (100 MIPS), while operating within strict power and thermal constraints. The design will be optimized for 45 nm or smaller technology nodes, showcasing the team’s ability to tackle modern semiconductor challenges.
